   REFLECTION
   I feel that I have completed all the initial requirements, I then completed some stretch goals by adding in a a back to top button and hover additions to some of my images, inks and buttons.

I struggled getting my head around managing so many different sections and knowing what to do, watching videos really helped with this as it also helped me to gain a better understanding of that the differnet elements really did, specially flex. It also helped me to learn new tools like transition and -webkit-background-clip: text;
-moz-background-clip: text;
-webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;
-moz-text-fill-color:
which Really helped me to get the desired effect I was looking for with my coloured h tags.
I also now understand how to use downloaded pictures, this really helps as i was sometimes having issues with just copying the URL.

Things I would work on going forward:
Although my pages are technically different when you click them from the nav bar (gear, journey) the only thing I changed was the h tags, If I had more time I would completely change the pages but I now understnd in principle how to do that.
I would also play around with differnet higher quality background images, and adding music and different functions to things.
I also didn't commit regularly enough, this is something I need to practice.
